### Screening AlexNet Hyperparameters with MNIST

Authors: Adam Rohde and Ashley Chiu

Date: December 6, 2019

Description: We deploy an experimental approach to hyperparameter tuning in the context of AlexNet. We investigate AlexNetâ€™s innovations, amongst other hyperparameters known to influence accuracy, to screen for the most important hyperparameters in an AlexNet-type CNN.

Dataset: MNIST
